## Clearing the Air
The site has been mostly taken down due to the fact that I've been kicked out of most of the community.

Despite popular belief in Rolling Lounge, I am not:
 - *what I am described as (source user)*
 - depressed (work)
 - playing victim (work)
 - salty (various users)
 - angry (various users)
 - emotionally damaged (the one who likes mlp)
 - pissed at the fact that I am banned (various users)

Honestly I do not care that I am banned anymore, I had gotten over the few seconds of despair I had experienced.

Some resources had been taken down due to various other reasons that I will not get into, but the resources that are still up will be listed below:

## Your Level in WebEditor
Your level is now accessible in the WebEditor page.

You were warned to regularly back up your level to your device, so consider this as simply a kind gesture from me.
